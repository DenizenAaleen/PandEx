        <h4>History of Development</h4>
        <p>The development of UNTBTBCS began in Java. At this time it was based on
        Pathfinder, due to being a class assignment requirement. It had fully
        implemented armor and weapons, as well as randomly generated enemies, and
        a level up system. Its character creation was limited to a name, picking
        very watered down classes and races. The classes and races only gave a 
        stat bonus upon creation and upon level up. There were no unique skills or
        features, and they all played the same.<br>This was scrapped to create fully
        integrated races and classes, although they were still based on Pathfinder.
        The next time it was scrapped was when everyone began dropping support for
        Java, and the search for a new language began. Eventually GML was chosen, 
        as this allowed for ease of access from various platforms. During this
        reboot period, the game began to take its own races and lore, and distanced
        itself from its Pathfinder origins, although it kept Pathfinder's classes.
        <br>GML had its own downsides, such as requiring complicated work arounds
        to, get input from the player for simple things such as name. Being able
        to do complicated things with ease but unable to do simple things without
        causing a headache slowed the development of the game, although its lore
        and systems continued growing outside of coding.<br>Currently development
        has aimed at making a simpler "proof of concept" game that is planned to run
        only in browers via javascript. After that is completed a 2D version of the
        game will be made with new features in GML, to aim at a larger audience,
        followed by a larger "offical" release with unique art and a full playable
        story, including both a campaign mode, and a sandbox mode that captures the
        feel of the first two implementations.
